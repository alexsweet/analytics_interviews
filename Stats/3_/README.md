Questions about Case-Control Study Design

## Question 1:

Subjects are selected into **case-control studies** based on their:
1. health outcome and exposure status
2. exposure status
3. health outcome or disease status


## Answer:

```

```

Subjects are selected based on whether or not they have the health outcome.
This is a unique characteristic of case-control studies because the outcome has already happened,
and what is left to examine is the difference in exposure
between those who develop the health outcome and those who do not develop the health outcome.


## Question 2:

Prostate cancer occurs mainly in older men. About 6 cases in 10 are diagnosed in men aged 65 or older, and it is rare before age 40.
The average age at the time of diagnosis is about 67. A case control study is conducted to determine the effect of
fish oil consumption on prostate cancer in the state of Colorado.
Which of the following would be an appropriate source population for this study?

1. The entire population of men in Colorado.
2. The entire population of men in Colorado over the age of 50.
3. The entire population of Colorado.

Although prostate cancer is sometimes diagnosed in younger men, the majority of men who develop prostate cancer are over the age of 50.
As a result, it is probably a good idea to limit the source population for this case-control study to those men who are truly at risk.
Although age 50 is an arbitrary cut-point for determining who will be included in the study,
it eliminates from the study population those men from the ages of 18 to 49, who may be at considerably
lower risk for prostate cancer than are older men.
