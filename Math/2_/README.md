# Simple Math Questions

**Disclaimer:** This question is not that I received from my interviews. I found this question online and thought
it is a pretty good question for analytics positions. Generally speaking, probability questions are always good!
The author who posted this question online mentioned that he received this question from Amazon.com


## Question:

```
50% of all people who receive a first interview receive a second interview.

95% of your friends that got a second interview felt they had a good first interview.

75% of your friends that DID NOT get a second interview felt they had a good first interview.
```

**If you feel that you had a good first interview, what is the probability you will receive a second interview?**
